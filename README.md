ðŸŽµ Smart Music Analyzer

Smart Music Analyzer is an interactive web app that analyzes audio files to provide detailed musical insights. With this app, users can:

-Predict the genre of the song using machine learning.

-Detect the tempo (BPM) and time signature (e.g., 4/4, 3/4, 6/8).

-Identify the key/scale of the music.

-Adjust playback speed and pitch in real-time.

-Visualize the audio waveform for better understanding of the song structure.

The app is built with Python, Streamlit, and librosa, leveraging ML models for genre prediction and advanced audio processing techniques for musical feature extraction. It allows users to upload their own songs and explore their musical characteristics in an intuitive interface.
