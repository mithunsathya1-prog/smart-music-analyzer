ðŸŽµ Smart Music Analyzer

Smart Music Analyzer is an interactive web application that provides detailed insights into your audio files. The app allows users to:

-Predict the genre of a song using machine learning models.

-Detect the tempo (BPM) and time signature (e.g., 4/4, 3/4, 6/8).

-Identify the key/scale of the music.

-Adjust playback speed and pitch in real-time for better audio analysis.

-Visualize the audio waveform to understand the song structure more clearly.

-Split audio into stems (vocals, drums, bass, piano, and more) and generate karaoke versions.

-Generate lyrics automatically in a stanza-wise format.

The app is built with Python, Streamlit, and librosa, leveraging ML models for genre prediction and advanced audio processing techniques for musical feature extraction. Users can upload their own songs and explore their musical characteristics through a clean, intuitive interface.
